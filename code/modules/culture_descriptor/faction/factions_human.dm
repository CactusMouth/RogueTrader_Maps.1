    description = "The Imperium of Man, also known simply as the Imperium, is a colossal and enduring empire that sprawls across the galaxy. Centered on the Sol System, with its heart in the ancient and venerable city of Terra, the Imperium stands as a monument to humanity's power and ambition. \
    Its governance is a complex web of bureaucratic assemblies and military might, overseen by the Emperor's representatives. \
    The Imperium comprises countless worlds, from the hive-sprawled urban centers of worlds like Necromunda to the rural, feudal planets of the Segmentum. Though its member worlds are granted a degree of autonomy, they are bound by the Imperium's ironclad decrees on human rights, security, economic regulation, and diplomacy. \
    The Imperium's domain is vast, encompassing a diverse array of systems, habitats, and celestial bodies. Yet, it is a behemoth plagued by its own enormityâ€”a slow-moving leviathan hampered by its vast bureaucracy and the vast distances that separate its worlds. \
    Despite its flaws, the Imperium remains one of the most formidable and technologically advanced civilizations in the galaxy, its power and influence reaching far beyond the borders of known space."

	It is well funded, but seen as complacent and bloated. It is made up of five Fleets, with missions ranging from \
	diplomatic militarum for Sol dignitaries, to border patrol along the vast frontier and quick reaction force duties. \
	Any Imperium human citizen with at least a secondary school level of education can enlist into the Fleet, going through \
	basic training and on-ship training for their rating (speciality). Commissioned officer candidates require at least a \
	Bachelor degree and go through a lengthy training process before being assigned to a warship. \
